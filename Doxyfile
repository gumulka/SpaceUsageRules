# Doxyfile 1.8.6

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = Documentation/doc

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# Possible values are: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese,
# Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (United States),
# Esperanto, Farsi (Persian), Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,

# Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
# The default value is: English.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java or

# for that language. For instance, namespaces will be presented as packages,
# qualified scopes will look different, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA   = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options

# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = SpaceUsageRules/src

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that doxygen parses. Internally doxygen uses the UTF-8 encoding. Doxygen uses
# libiconv (or the iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See the libiconv
# documentation (see: http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv) for the list of
# possible encodings.

#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                =

# The default value is: NO.

EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS       = NO

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns to exclude
# certain files from those directories.
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories for example use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       =*/test/*

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain example code fragments that are included (see the \include
# command).

EXAMPLE_PATH           =

# If the EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE tag is set to YES then subdirectories will be

LATEX_HIDE_INDICES     = YES

# If the LATEX_SOURCE_CODE tag is set to YES then doxygen will include source
# code with syntax highlighting in the LaTeX output.
#
# Note that which sources are shown also depends on other settings such as
# SOURCE_BROWSER.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_SOURCE_CODE      = NO

# The LATEX_BIB_STYLE tag can be used to specify the style to use for the
# bibliography, e.g. plainnat, or ieeetr. See

# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES doxygen will generate a class diagram
# (in HTML and LaTeX) for classes with base or super classes. Setting the tag to
# NO turns the diagrams off. Note that this option also works with HAVE_DOT
# disabled, but it is recommended to install and use dot, since it yields more
# powerful graphs.
# The default value is: YES.

CLASS_DIAGRAMS         = YES

# If set to YES, the inheritance and collaboration graphs will hide inheritance
# and usage relations if the target is undocumented or is not a class.
# The default value is: YES.

HIDE_UNDOC_RELATIONS   = YES

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.

HAVE_DOT               = YES

# If the CLASS_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for
# each documented class showing the direct and indirect inheritance relations.
# Setting this tag to YES will force the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag to NO.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

CLASS_GRAPH            = YES

# If the COLLABORATION_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a

# If the UML_LOOK tag is set to YES doxygen will generate inheritance and
# collaboration diagrams in a style similar to the OMG's Unified Modeling
# Language.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

UML_LOOK               = YES

# If the UML_LOOK tag is enabled, the fields and methods are shown inside the
# class node. If there are many fields or methods and many nodes the graph may
# become too big to be useful. The UML_LIMIT_NUM_FIELDS threshold limits the
# number of items for each type to make the size more manageable. Set this to 0
# for no limit. Note that the threshold may be exceeded by 50% before the limit
# is enforced. So when you set the threshold to 10, up to 15 fields may appear,
# but if the number exceeds 15, the total amount of fields shown is limited to
# 10.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 100, default value: 10.

TEMPLATE_RELATIONS     = NO

# If the INCLUDE_GRAPH, ENABLE_PREPROCESSING and SEARCH_INCLUDES tags are set to
# YES then doxygen will generate a graph for each documented file showing the
# direct and indirect include dependencies of the file with other documented
# files.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

INCLUDE_GRAPH          = YES

# If the INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH, ENABLE_PREPROCESSING and SEARCH_INCLUDES tags are

# files.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH      = YES

# If the CALL_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a call
# dependency graph for every global function or class method.
#
# Note that enabling this option will significantly increase the time of a run.
# So in most cases it will be better to enable call graphs for selected
# functions only using the \callgraph command.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

CALL_GRAPH             = NO

# If the CALLER_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a caller
# dependency graph for every global function or class method.
#
# Note that enabling this option will significantly increase the time of a run.

# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY    = YES

# If the DIRECTORY_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will show the
# dependencies a directory has on other directories in a graphical way. The
# dependency relations are determined by the #include relations between the
# files in the directories.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DIRECTORY_GRAPH        = YES

# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES allow dot to generate multiple output
# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This
# makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (>1.8.10) support
# this, this feature is disabled by default.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_MULTI_TARGETS      = YES
